Overview
-------------------------------

In this repository, we aim to numerically solve the minimization problem
$\min _{x \in K} J(x)$


Here, $f$ and $g$ are two given functions. We will construct another function from $K$ to $I R$, denoted as $\mathrm{J_n}$. Subsequently, a numerical study is conducted on $\mathrm{J}_{\mathrm{n}}$, including the development of algorithms to compute the minimum of this new function.
